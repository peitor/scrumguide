The Definitive Guide to Scrum:
The Rules of the Game

July 2011

Developed and sustained by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland


Purpose of the Scrum Guide
Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products This Guide contains the
definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that
bind them together. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum Guide is
written and provided by them. We stand behind the Scrum Guide.
Scrum Overview
Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while
productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Scrum is:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Extremely difficult to master
Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development
since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a
framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear
the relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can
improve.
Scrum Framework
The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and
rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to
Scrum’s success and usage.
Specific strategies for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.
The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and
interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this
document.

Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based what is true and known. Scrum
employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
inspection, and adaptation.
Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a
common understanding of what is being seen.
For example:
- A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,
- A common definition of “Done”1 must be shared by those performing the work and those
accepting the work product.
Inspection
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a goal to detect
undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way
of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at
the point of work.
Adaptation
If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize
further deviation.
Scrum prescribes four formal opportunities for inspection and adaptation, as described in the
Scrum Events section of this document.
- Sprint Planning Meeting
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review Meeting
- Sprint Retrospective

Scrum
Scrum is a framework structured to support complex product development. Scrum consists of
Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the
framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.
The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and
interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this
document.
The Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to
accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional
teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and
productivity.
Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
feedback. Incremental deliveries of ““Done”” product ensure a potentially useful version of
working product is always available.
The Product Owner
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value the product and the work of the
Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and
individuals.
The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product
Backlog management includes:
- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what
the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level
needed.
The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the
Product Owner remains accountable.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the
desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a backlog item’s
priority must convince the Product Owner.
For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The
Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog.
No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of priorities, and
the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.
The Development Team
The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the
Development Team create the Increment.
Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and
manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall
efficiency and effectiveness. Development Teams have the following characteristics:
- They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create
a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer.
Regardless of the work being performed by the person, there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Individuals Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole; and,
- Development Teams do not contain sub-teams dedicated to particular domains like testing
or business analysis.
Development Team Size
Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to
complete significant work. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction
and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill
constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a
potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much
coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process
to manage. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless
they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.
The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters
do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules. The
Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.

The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions
with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change
these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.
Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Clearly communicating vision, goals, and Product Backlog items to the Development Team;
- Teaching the Development Team to create clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Understanding long-term product planning in an empirical environment;
- Understanding and practicing agility; and,
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:
- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Teaching and leading the Development Team to create high value products;
- Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; and,
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet
fully adopted and understood.
Scrum Master Service to the Organization
The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:
- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product
development;
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,
- Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum
in the organization.
Scrum Events
Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings
not defined in Scrum. Scrum uses time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum
duration. This ensures an appropriate amount of time is spent planning without allowing waste
in the planning process.

Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is an
opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable
critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced
transparency and is a lost opportunity to insect and adapt.
The Sprint
The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable,
and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations
throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
previous Sprint.
Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning Meeting, Daily Scrums, the development work,
the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.
During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would affect the Sprint Goal;
- Development Team composition and quality goals remain constant; and,
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development
Team as more is learned.
Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects,
Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has of a definition of what is to be built, a
design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.
Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable
predictability to inspection and adaptation progress toward a goal at least every calendar
month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.
Cancelling a Sprint
A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time box is over. Only the Product Owner has the
authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the
stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.
A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the
company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint
should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short
duration of Sprints, it rarely makes sense to do so.
When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog Items are reviewed. If
part of the work is potentially shippable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete
Product Backlog Items are re-estimated put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on
them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.

Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone has to regroup in another Sprint
Planning Meeting to start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum
Team, and are very uncommon.
Sprint Planning Meeting
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning Meeting. This plan is
created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
The Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter
Sprints, the event is proportionately shorter. For example, two-week Sprints have four-hour
Sprint Planning Meetings.
The Sprint Planning Meeting consists of two parts, each one being a time-box of one half of the
Sprint Planning Meeting duration. The two parts of the Sprint Planning Meeting answer the
following questions, respectively:
- What will be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
Part One: What will be done this Sprint?
In this part, the Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed
during the Sprint. The Product Owner presents the top priority Product Backlog items to the
Development Team and the entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the
Sprint.
The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected
capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development
Team. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the
upcoming Sprint.
After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the
Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the
Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the
Development Team on why it is building the Increment.
Part Two: How will the chosen work get done?
Having selected the work of the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this
functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items
selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog
The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert
the Product Backlog into working product increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated
effort. However, enough work is planned during the Sprint Planning meeting for the

Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned
for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed to units of one day or
less by the end of this meeting. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in
the Sprint Backlog, both during the Sprint Planning Meeting and as needed throughout the
Sprint.
The Product Owner may be present during the second part of the Sprint Planning Meeting to
clarify the selected Product Backlog items and to help make trade-offs. If the Development
Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the Sprint Backlog items
with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite other people to attend in order
to provide technical or domain advice.
By the end of the Sprint Planning meeting, the Development Team should be able to explain to
the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to
accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.
Sprint Goal
The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality
implemented within the Sprint.
As the Development Team works, it keeps this goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it
implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the
Development Team expected, then they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the
scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.
The Sprint Goal may be a milestone in the larger purpose of the product roadmap.
Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum meeting is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to
synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the
work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next
one.
The Daily Scrum is at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the
meeting, each Development Team member explains:
- What has been accomplished since the last meeting?
- What will be done before the next meeting?
- What obstacles are in the way?
The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to assess progress toward the Sprint Goal and to
assess how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily
Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. The
Development Team often meets immediately after the Daily Scrum to re-plan the rest of the

Sprint’s work. Every day, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner
and Scrum Master how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the
goal and create the anticipated increment in the remainder of the Sprint.
The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development
Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the
Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.
The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the
Daily Scrum. The Daily Scrum is not a status meeting, and is for the people transforming the
Product Backlog items into an Increment.
Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify and remove
impediments to development, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the
Development Team’s level of project knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting.
Sprint Review
A Sprint Review meeting is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the
Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders
collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product
Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done. This is
an informal meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and
foster collaboration.
This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less time is
allocated for shorter Sprints. For example, two week Sprints have two-hour Sprint Reviews.
The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
- The Product Owner identifies what has been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
- The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran
into, and how those problems were solved;
- The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions
about the Increment;
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely
completion dates based on progress to date; and,
- The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides
valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning Meetings.
The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product
Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new
opportunities.

Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan
for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning
Meeting. This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. Proportionately less
time is allocated for shorter Sprints.
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.
The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process
framework, its development process and practices to make it more effective and enjoyable for
the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase
product quality by expanding the Definition of “Done” as appropriate.
By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements
that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is
the adaptation to the inspection of the Development Team itself. Although improvements may
be implemented at any time, the Sprint Review provides a dedicated event focused on
inspection and adaptation.
Scrum Artifacts
Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful in providing
transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are
specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information needed to ensure Scrum
Teams are successful in delivering a “Done” Increment.
Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is
the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product
Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.
A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially
known and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the
environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly
changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. As long
as a product exists, a Product Backlog also exists.

The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and bug fixes
that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items
have the attributes of a description, order, and estimate.
The Product Backlog is often ordered by value, risk, priority, and necessity. Top-ordered Product
Backlog items drive immediate development activities. The higher the order, the more a Product
Backlog item has been considered, and the more consensus exists regarding it and its value.
Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones.
More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower
the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team for the
upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one item can be “Done”
within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team
within one Sprint are deemed “ready” or “actionable” for selection in a Sprint Planning meeting.
As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product
Backlog becomes a larger and more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, and a
Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or
technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.
Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used
to describe the upcoming work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items is
then employed.
Product backlog grooming is the act of adding detail, estimates, and priority to items in the
Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development
Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog grooming,
items are reviewed and revised. However, they can be updated at any time by the Product
Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.
Grooming is a part-time activity during a Sprint between the Product Owner and the
Development Team. Often the Development Team has the domain knowledge to perform
grooming itself. How and when grooming is done is decided by the Scrum Team. Grooming
usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.
The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the
Team by helping understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work
make the final estimate.
Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal
At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product
Owner tracks this total work remaining at least for every Sprint Review. The Product Owner
compares this amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress

toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information is made
transparent to all stakeholders.
Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Product Backlog Items. The work remaining
and date are the only variables of interest.
Various trend burndown, burnup and other projective practices have been used to forecast
progress. These have proven useful. However, these do not replace the importance of
empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has happened
may be used for forward-looking decision-making.
Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for
delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast
by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work
needed to deliver that functionality.
The Sprint Backlog defines the work the Development Team will perform to turn Product
Backlog items into a “Done” Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the
Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.
The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in
the Daily Scrum. The Development Team modifies Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the
Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence occurs as the Development Team
works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.
As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is
performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan
are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint
Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real time picture of the work that
the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the
Development Team.
Monitoring Sprint Progress
At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog items can be
summed. The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum.
The Development Team tracks these sums daily and projects the likelihood of achieving the
Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the Development Team can
manage its progress.
Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items. The work remaining
and date are the only variables of interest.

Increment
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all
previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be ““Done””, which means it
must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s Definition of “Done”. It must be in
useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.
Definition of “Done”
When the Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must
understand what “Done” means. Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members
must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure
transparency. This is the “Definition of “Done”” for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when
work is complete on the product Increment.
The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items
it can select during a Sprint Planning Meeting. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver
Increments of potentially shippable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current
Definition of “Done”.
Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment
is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it. Each Increment is additive
to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.
As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their Definition of “Done” will expand to include
more stringent criteria for higher quality.
Conclusion
Scrum is free and offered in this guide. Scrum’s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are immutable
and although implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists
only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and
practices.

People
Of the thousands of people who have contributed to Scrum, we should single out those who
were instrumental in its first ten years. First there was Jeff Sutherland, working with Jeff
McKenna, and Ken Schwaber, working with Mike Smith and Chris Martin. Many others
contributed in the ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined as it is
today. David Starr provided key insights and editorial skills in formulating this version of the
Scrum Guide.
History
Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first co-presented Scrum at the OOPSLA conference in 1995.
This presentation essentially documented the learning that Ken and Jeff had over the previous
few years applying Scrum.
The history of Scrum is already considered long. To honor the first places where it was tried and
refined, we recognize Individual, Inc., Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Medical).
